> Define and describe AJAX
  AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.  This allows developers to update a web page wihtout reloading the page. It allows devs to request and receive data from a server after the page has loaded!  It also allows us to send data to a server while running in the background as well, doing all these tasks asynchronously without interfering with the display and behaviour of the existing page.


>Define and describe the DOM
   Stands for the Document Object Model.  The DOM is a tree-like structure wherein each node is an object represting a part of the document.  The objects can be manipulated programmatically and any visible changes occuring as a result may then be refelcted in the display of the document. 


>Define and describe CSS (Cascading)
  Cascading Style Sheet is used for describing the presentation of the document weritten in a markup language.  The style sheet with the highest priority controls the content display. Declarations not set in the highest priority source are passed on to a source of lower priority, such as the user agent style; called cascading.


>Define and describe HTML
  Hyper Text Markup Language is the standard markup language for the web.  HTML elements are the buildilng blocks of HTML pages.  With HTML constructs, images and other objects may be embedded into the rendered page.  


>Describe how events work
  Event handlers can be used to handle, verify, user input, user actdions, and browser actdions: Things or actions that should be done every time a page loads.  Things that should be done when the page is closed, and even actiosn taht should be performed when a user clicks a button.


>Describe jQuery
   Is essentially a cross-platform JavaSript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML.  It is free, open-source software to help the UI or user interface interactions, with effects, widgets, and themes.


>Descdribe event delegation/bubbling
   Event delegation refers to the process of using event propagation (bubbling) to handle events at a higher level in the DOM than the element on which the event originated (outside in).  
   Event bubbling (capturing) are two ways of event propagation in the HTML, DOM, API, when an event occurs in the element inside another element and both elements have registered a handle for that event (occurs inside out).


>Describe how linking to stylesheets/images/scripts works as far as requests/responses



>Describe how URLs are resolved in a browswer (http request, server..etc.)
